## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some css code I'm proud of</h1>
```
input:required:invalid, input:focus:invalid {
    background-image: url(./images/icon-error.svg);
    background-position: right top;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    border: 2px solid red;
    -moz-box-shadow: none;
  }
```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Some Javascript functions were relatively new in trying to achieve the client side validation, so i think i will try to look into more functions to aid in achieving better performance forms

### Useful resources

- [ resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This helped me for in uderstanding client side validation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [ resource 2](https://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/html5-form-validation/) - This is also an amazing article.
